# SE 489 · MLOps — Course Code

Reference code, starter files, and exercise scaffolding for **SE 489: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** at DePaul University, taught by [Vahid Alizadeh](https://github.com/Alizadeh-DePaul).

> Exercise instructions, lecture content, and class notes live in the course website. This repo holds the **code** — what you'll open in your editor, run locally, and commit back.

├── handson-ml3/                ← supplementary notebooks from Géron's book
├── intro-to-pytorch/           ← optional PyTorch primers
├── data/                       ← small sample datasets used by exercises
└── requirements.txt            ← baseline pinned deps for the exercises
```

Each exercise folder under `Exercises/` is self-contained: a short README pointing back to its page, a `pyproject.toml` (where applicable), and the Python source files students edit. Solutions for every exercise live under `Exercises-Solutions/` **locally**, but that path is git-ignored so they don't appear on GitHub.

## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/Alizadeh-DePaul/MLOps-Course-Codes.git
cd MLOps-Course-Codes

# 2. Create an isolated environment (Python 3.11 recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate            # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install baseline deps (each exercise may add more)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Jump into whichever exercise the lecture points to
cd Exercises/GoodCodingPractices
cat README.md
```

Most exercises only touch files inside their own folder, so you can safely work on one without worrying about the rest.

## Conventions

- **Python 3.11** is the target for new exercises added in 2026. Older folders may still target 3.9/3.10.
- **Ruff** (linter + formatter) and **mypy** (type checker) are the default code-quality tools. Exercises that use them ship a `pyproject.toml` with the relevant config.
- Starter files contain `# TODO:` comments where students should make changes. The docstring for each file explains the goal.
- Solutions live in `Exercises-Solutions/<Exercise>/` **locally** and are deliberately excluded from git.

## Contributing / feedback

Found a typo or a bug in the starter code? Open an issue or a PR — or just flag it in class. Suggestions that make the exercises clearer or more realistic are always welcome.
